Combating Deepfake Fraud in Insurance: A Strategic and Ethical AI-Driven Response

Report Introduction: This report designs an AI-driven solution to address the increasingly severe issue of deepfake fraud in the insurance industry.

Research Contributions:

Systematic Problem Diagnosis: Applied the Ethical Reasoning Framework (ERF) and the ACM Code of Ethics to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the financial losses, trust erosion, and underlying ethical dilemmas caused by deepfakes in the insurance sector.

AI Solution Design: Independently designed a technical architecture named the "Deepfake Detection and Response System (DDRS)". The solution integrates multiple advanced detection techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) , the Xception architecture , and eye-blinking pattern analysis.

Integration of Ethics and Technology: Integrated ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and privacy protection into the technical design , proposing a comprehensive strategy that includes bias auditing , model explainability , and secure data management.
